At first glance a simple to-do app, but powered by a powerful backend working behind the scenes.

The purpose of this app was to start out with a backend project using Node js.
I managed to create a secure and straightforward app that will protect your notes data from any attackers.

Since I really cared about performances I had enough freetime I also successfully added Redis caching system, another advanced feature that will make yours notes display as quickly as possible. 

For the client side I used React, which smoothly interacts with the Express backend. Taking some inspiration from the internet and using a great amount of creativity I was able to create the best design for this application. The fly in the ointment is that it doesn't look on mobile screen as in the desktop version for design reasons. 
The App is really powerful and efficient, you can verify his performance using  web.dev.
